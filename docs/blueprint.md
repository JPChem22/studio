## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm Beige or Taupe (e.g., `#D7CCC8` or a sophisticated light brown like `#A1887F` but used as a dominant light base). Earthy tones like beige and taupe can feel warm, inviting, and grounded, yet still maintain a professional and elegant look, especially when paired with darker contrasts.
- Secondary color: Deep Brown or Rich Burgundy (e.g., `#5D4037` - a deep brown, or `#880E4F` - a deep, muted purple/burgundy). A darker, rich secondary color adds depth and a sense of luxury or established quality against the lighter primary.
- Accent: Muted Orange or Terracotta (e.g., `#FFB74D` - a soft orange, or `#E3856B`). A muted warm color like a soft orange or terracotta can serve as an engaging accent that isn't overly bright but provides a friendly call to action. Orange can evoke warmth and creativity.
- Clean and professional font choices, like a sans-serif for headings and a serif for body text.
- Clear and intuitive layout with a focus on readability and user-friendliness.
- Use of simple, easily recognizable icons to represent features and actions.
